Daniel's Inclusive Foods Blog

Project Outline
The blog consists of a CSS file that is mobile-first, meaning that it was first coded for mobile devices. Certain functions, such as the hamburger menu, only appear in the mobile version.

In the desktop view, other features like the aside show up, and the hamburger menu disappears, showing the navigation.

The website includes a way to post blogs, comment on those blogs, search blog posts, and sort by the date.
